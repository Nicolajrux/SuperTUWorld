  <h1>MAR-Building [MAR]</h1>

  <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Looking for a chill spot to hit the books with your buddies? MAR is the place to be! No need to register for anything, and after tutorials wrap up, the study rooms are usually wide open for you to take over. I used to pop in on Saturdays and Sundays too, but just a heads-up—the TU opening hours can change like the weather, so you'll want to check the schedule yourself!</p>

  <p><strong>Next Magic Word:</strong> Check out the painting above! The full first name (6 letters) is your magic password to the next adventure.</p>

  <p><strong>Next location:</strong> The Math Building—let’s go crunch some numbers!</p>

  <p><strong>Freitagsrunde:</strong> Don’t miss out on the Freitagsrunde! This awesome initiative is also based in the MAR building, and they’ve put together a treasure trove of past exam questions from all sorts of courses. If you’re lucky, you might just find your subject <a href="https://docs.freitagsrunde.org/Klausuren/">right here</a>. And since math exams tend to be oral after the fourth BA semester, you might have better luck snagging old protocols for those oral exams at the Math initiative. Happy hunting!</p>
