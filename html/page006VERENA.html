<h1>The Math Building [MA]</h1>


<p><strong>What to do:</strong> The math building is dope! Some people say its ugly or its bad cuz all the toilets are smelly and half of the building is disfunctional. But its special in its own charm. </p>

<p><strong>Next Magic Word</strong> : In the math buildings there are alot of stickers. You are looking for a particular green one with an integral sign on it! A little help: One sticker is on the side of the lockers on the picture (2nd floor). The next password is the the word on those stickers. It consits of exactly 8 symbols! <strong>Only Caps no special characters</strong></p>

<p><strong>What to do:</strong>
First of all, there’s the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/math/bibliothek">Math Library</a> on the first floor, where you can study and borrow books. If you're too lazy to carry your stuff every day, you can rent a locker from the library for six months for free. The locker rooms are on the eighth floor of the math building, which is really convenient. 

Sometimes, it’s also helpful to search for books using the library's catalog, <a href="https://tu-berlin.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=TUB&lang=en_US">Primo</a>. If you want to work on a computer, a better place is the Unix pool on the second floor. It’s usually open from 10 AM to 6 PM. If you're already there and have your <strong>Immatrikulationsbescheinigung</strong> (certificate of registration), you can get a <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/math/unix-pool/services/erstellung-eines-accounts">Unix Pool</a> account for free. The cool thing about that is you can print 100 pages in black and white each month. Some classes require you to print out your homework, so that can be really helpful. You can also access your Unix account via SSH. I have <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438">a-Shell</a> installed on my phone, or I use the regular shell on my Linux computer. 

From the terminal, I can send a file from my phone or laptop using the command "scp Folder/file NAME@unixpool.math.tu-berlin.de:Desktop/", and then log into my Unix account with "ssh NAME@unixpool.math.tu-berlin.de". After that, I can print the file using "lpr -Pps1 Desktop/file". Pretty cool, right? The Unix pool is usually quite empty, even though it’s a really nice place to study.

On the fifth to eighth floors, there are many seminar rooms where you might have tutorials or study after classes. I like them because they have chalkboards. On the eighth floor, there's also the Math Cafe, where you can get drinks like mate and beer at cheap prices since they are non-profit. Rooms 848 and 849 are always open for students during the math building's working hours.
