  <strong>Main Building:</strong> The Main Building at TU Berlin dates back to 1884, built in a grand neo-Renaissance style to show off the importance of engineering and technical education. But it didn’t have an easy ride – the building took a heavy hit during World War II and was basically in ruins by 1945. After the war, they started rebuilding it, keeping some of the original look while mixing in modern touches. By the 1960s, it was mostly done, and now the Main Building is back to being one of the central spots on campus, with the biggest lecture hall, classrooms, and all the important admin offices.
