<h1>Volkswagenbiblithek / Main Library [BIB] </h1>

<p><strong>When: </strong>Monday-Friday 09:00-00:00, Sattuday 10:00-00:00, Sunday Closed </p>




<p><strong>What to do:</strong> You can study there like any other library. Lockers are on the ground floor—bring your own lock if you have one, or just take your backpack upstairs. There are computers you can log into with your TU account, and extra screens if you want a second monitor for your laptop. They’ve also got printers, but you’ll need your Mensa card to pay for that.</p>

<p><strong>Next Magic Word:</strong> The next magic word is written on the wall behind the giant head <strong>WRITE THE MAGIC WORD ALL CAPS</strong>. You find the head in the main library.</p>

<p><strong>Next location: </strong> The Main Cafeteria is located right next to the [EW] building, opposite to the Stein platz</p>


<p><strong>Library Information</strong>
During exam season, the main library can become very crowded. The smaller libraries, such as the ones in the Math or Physics buildings, are usually calmer. You can check out all the TU libraries on this <a href='https://www.tu.berlin/en/ub/about-us/locations'>LINK</a>. If you need to discuss something with your group, you can also book rooms in the library on this <a href='https://www.tu.berlin/en/ub/study-work/study-rooms-storage/group-study-rooms'>site</a>.
